# OOP-Final
Repository for OOP Final Project

## PackardPowerRankings Project Description
The aim of this project is to enhance the user experience of a sports game tracker/prediction web app. This semester, we delved into documentation, UML diagrams, AWS Lightsail deployment, backups, and working on a development team. Next semester, we plan to implement server-side improvements, front-end enhancements, and database optimization, so we can significantly reduce load times and improve overall performance.
